# About

As a __Digital Solution Architect__ and __DevOps Engineer__, I have been helping entrepreneurs build the technology that
powers their organizations for decades. I attach particular importance to Green Computing and quality. I've built 
everything from marketing websites to full SaaS platforms and everything in between.

With a university degree in computer science, I am a passionate problem solver and love implementing complex and
challenging projects. I am good at learning the ropes quickly and meeting demanding business requirements for
industry-specific systems.

As a Software Engineer, I am an all-in-one solution and able to implement ideas from conception through completion to
operations, following the entire process from the beginning.

Whether you're a non-technical founder building your first app or an established company with an existing tech team, I'm
ready to help bring your next big idea to life.
