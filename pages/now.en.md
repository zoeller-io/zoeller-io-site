# Now

What I'm doing right now...


## Green Computing

I have been working on the topic of [Green Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_computing){target=_blank} for 
some time now. In particular, creating and operating software efficiently and sustainably.

## Learn Go

I have primarily used PHP for 20 years. Python was added 10 years ago. For the next 10 years, I think the Go 
programming language I'm currently learning is right for me.

## Consolidate GitHub

Since the beginning of 2024 I have been consolidating my different GitHub accounts. In the future I will only use 
[https://github.com/zoeller-io](https://github.com/zoeller-io).


## Get CompTIA Certificate



I am currently continuing my education in the field of cybersecurity and am trying to get the
[CompTIA Security+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/security) SY0-701 certificate in the near future.
